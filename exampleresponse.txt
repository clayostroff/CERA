# Trump Tariffs: A New Era of U.S. Trade Policy

Since returning to office in 2025...

## Policy Measures and Timeline

Since January 2025, President Trump has enacted a series of high-profile tariff measures and initiated several trade investigations, marking a significant escalation in US trade policy. The first major action came on January 20, 2025, when President Trump signed an executive order directing cabinet officials to report on unfair trade practices, and to provide recommendations for new tariffs by April 1. 

By February 4, a sweeping 10 percent tariff on all imports from China took effect. This was soon elevated: on March 4, another 10 percent increase was applied, bringing cumulative tariffs on Chinese goods to 20 percent. These actions were justified on grounds of addressing trade imbalances and curbing illegal fentanyl flows associated with China. In retaliation, China imposed a 34 percent duty on all US goods starting April 10, 2025, along with targeted restrictions on key US exports[1][5][6].
